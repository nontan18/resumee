## OBJECTIVE
One day, my college senior told me to apply for a job at Google, and when I saw the selection page, I was shocked! He said, “Write a “resume” in English and turn it in! What’s a “resume”? You mean the ones they hand out in college? I heard from a follower that it was a text written by LaTeX! So for friends who can only write Markdown like me, I’ve started a job to render it to look like it!

## EXPERIENCE
- Read and agreed to the **TERMS AND CONDITION** below.
- Downloaded [“resumee.md”](https://resumee.work/assets/documents/resumee.md) from among the number of stars on the Internet.
- Edited “resumee.md” with the help of [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) who learned enough to leave [Google](https://google.com) in charge
- Dragged the edited “resumee.md” 4 times the width of desktop and dropped onto this page.
- Published my resume by [resumee.work](https://resumee.work) and shared the link with you.

## LEADERSHIP
I’m doing some Markdown proselytizing on Github! Unfortunately, I’m still the only contributor, but I think true leadership is to keep fighting for what you believe in, even if it’s just one person!

## TECHNICAL STRENGTH
**Programming Languages**   Typescript, Markdown  
**Frameworks and Services** Angular 9, Express, Docker

## AWARDS
### **Nothing but…**
X people viewed this page and X resumes created by me.  If you will be helped by me and get a job, please let me know it.

## EDUCATION
### **Shonan Fujisawa University** | *April 2016 - March 2021*
Bachelor of Arts in Everything but People and the Earth. | **GPA 3.1 / 4**

## TERMS AND CONDITION
With this service, your resume will be published on the Internet. In other words, someone might exploit it and make a nuisance of you. I take no responsibility for it.

## GIVE ME A JOB OFFER
To be honest, I don’t have a job offer since April 2021. If you have a attention to me, access to [**MY RESUMEE**](https://bit.ly/2Vtdirp) and email me. その場合のメッセージは日本語でお願いしますm(_ _)m Because I am not good at English and want to work in Japan.
